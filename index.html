        Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top

        Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began
        its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental service, Netflix is the
        most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 238.39
        million paid memberships in more than 190 countries.[7] By 2022,
        "Netflix Original" productions accounted for half of its library in the
        United States and the namesake company had ventured into other
        categories, such as video game publishing of mobile games via its
        flagship service. As of October 2023, Netflix is the 24th most-visited
        website in the world with 23.66% of its traffic coming from the United
        States, followed by the United Kingdom at 5.84% and Brazil at 5.64%.
